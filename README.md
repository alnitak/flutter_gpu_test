# flutter_gpu_test

A shader test using `flutter_gpu` package.

## Getting Started

I run this only on Android. 
The `flutter_gpu` is available in Flutter `main` channel. Switch to that with:
```
flutter channel main
flutter upgrade
```

When running the example the Impeller engine must be enabled on Android. Run with
`flutter run --enable-impeller`

On iOS it is enabled by default.
